# Carbon Mapper Methane Plume Dataset

This dataset contains enriched methane plume observations extracted from the Carbon Mapper public dashboard. The data has been processed into a geospatially-aware format with both point and polygon geometries, cleaned metadata, and references to associated image assets (TIFF/PNG). The primary focus region is the Permian Basin, Texas, USA.

## ü™Ñ Processing Steps

1. CSV ingested from Carbon Mapper dashboard
2. Bounding box string converted to `shapely` `Polygon`
3. Point geometry fallback added
4. Geometry assigned using `geopandas`
5. Plume image and GeoTIFF references bundled as JSON metadata
6. Exported to `.parquet` using EPSG:4326
